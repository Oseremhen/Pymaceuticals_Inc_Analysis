# Pymaceuticals, Inc. specializing in anti-cancer medications analysis

Situation: As a senior data analyst at a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications,
you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. 
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, 
tumor development was observed and measured.
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Analysis created: 
Using Matplotlib and Pandas on jupyter notbook, generate the following;

A summary table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for all drug regimen used.

A bar plot using Pandas's DataFrame and Matplotlib pyplot that shows the number of mice tested for each treatment regimen.

A pie plot using Pandas's DataFrame and Matplotlib pyplot that shows the distribution of male and female mice in the study.

Calculation of the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), the quartiles, IQR and potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

A box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for four treatment group, highlighting any potential outliers in the plot 

A line plot of timepoints versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

Calculation of the pearson correlation and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.

Plotted the linear regression model on the previous scatter plot.

Observations that can made from the data is included at the top of the notebook (pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb).
